Django actions

Django actions can be accessed right clicking a project with the Django configuration and choosing Django > action.



Another option is using (with focus on a PyDev editor):

ctrl+2+dj <enter> to open a dialog with the history of entered actions
ctrl+2+dj action_to_execute <enter> to already pass the action to be executed (e.g.: ctrl+2+dj help <enter>)
