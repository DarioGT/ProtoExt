3. Generate a new SSH key. 
To generate a new SSH key, enter the code below. We want the default settings so when asked to enter a file in which to save the key, just press enter.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@mail.com"
Generating pub/priv rsa key pair
Enter file in which to save the key


4.Â Â Add your SSH key to GitHub. 

On the GitHub site Click â€œAccount Settingsâ€ > Click â€œSSH Public Keysâ€ > Click â€œAdd another public keyâ€

Open the id_rsa.pub file with a text editor (Notepad, TextEdit, or gedit will do just fine). 
This is your public SSH key. You may need turn on â€œview hidden filesâ€ to find it because the .ssh directory is hidden. 
Itâ€™s important you copy your SSH key exactly as it is written without adding any newlines or whitespace. 
Now paste it into the â€œKeyâ€ field.


5. Test everything out.

To make sure everything is working youâ€™ll now SSH to GitHub. Donâ€™t change the â€œgit@github.comâ€ part. Thatâ€™s supposed to be there.

$ ssh -T git@github.com
(Attempts to ssh to github)

Which should give you this:

The authenticity of host 'github.com (207.97.227.239)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is 16:27:ac:a5:76:28:2d:36:63:1b:56:4d:eb:df:a6:48.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?

Donâ€™t worry, this is supposed to happen. Type â€œyesâ€.

Hi username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
